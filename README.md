# Mental Health Classifier with XAI üåüüß†‚ù§Ô∏è

## Project Overview

This project is an artificial intelligence model developed to classify emotional health conditions based on text data. The model classifies user-provided sentences into categories such as **Anxiety**, **Bipolar Disorder**, **Depression**, **Normal**, **Personality Disorder**, **Stress**, and **Suicidal**. The project not only provides accurate classification results but also uses **LIME** and **PCA** techniques for explainable AI (XAI), making it easier to understand the model‚Äôs decision-making process.

üéØ The project is available as a live demo on Hugging Face : üéØ

## Key Features üåü

- **Text Classification**: Classifies sentences entered by users into 7 emotional health classes.
- **MPNet Embeddings**: Converts text into meaningful vector representations.
- **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces high-dimensional data to lower dimensions. Specifically, **PCA** reduces 768-dimensional data obtained from the **MPNet** model to 400 dimensions while preserving over 96.54% of the data.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: A powerful classifier for multi-class data.
- **LIME for Explainability**: Visually explains which words influenced the model's decisions.
- **Balancing (Random Under-sampling)**: Equalizes the sample size of over-represented classes to ensure that the model gives equal importance to all classes.
- **Cross-Validation**: The model is validated using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure reliability.

## Methods Used üåü

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data is converted to lowercase.
   - Links, HTML tags, punctuation, and numbers are cleaned.
   - Missing values are removed.
   
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **MPNet** model is used to convert text into vector representations.
   - **PCA** is applied for dimensionality reduction (768 dimensions reduced to 400 dimensions, preserving 91% of the data).

3. **Class Imbalance Management**:
   - **Random Under-sampling** is used to equalize the sample size of imbalanced classes.

4. **Model Training**:
   - **XGBoost** algorithm is used for model training.
   - **SMOTE** is applied to increase the sample size for the under-represented class.

5. **Explainability**:
   - **LIME** is used to visually explain the model's decisions based on the words that most influenced the predictions.

6. **Application Development**:
   - The trained model is integrated into a **chatbot** interface, where users can input sentences and classify their emotional state.
