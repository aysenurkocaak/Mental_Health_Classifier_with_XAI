In this project:
📝 We used MPNet-based sentence embeddings to semantically represent text.
🔽 Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
📈 Built a mental health prediction model using XGBoost.
⚖️ Improved model performance by applying random undersampling to balance the imbalanced dataset.
🔍 Integrated LIME to enhance the interpretability of the model predictions.
🎛️ Designed a user-friendly interface accessible to everyone using Gradio! 🌐

Our application predicts possible mental health states (✨ Anxiety, Bipolar, Depression, Normal, Personality Disorder, Stress, Suicidal ✨)
 based on the sentences entered by the user! 🧠💬

During the model development process, we focused on:

🔧 Feature engineering,
🥊 Model comparisons,
⚙️ Hyperparameter optimization,
📊 Advanced techniques such as undersampling to reduce class imbalance!
